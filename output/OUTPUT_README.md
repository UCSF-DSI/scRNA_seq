### About these outputs:

This is where data outputs are generated from these notebooks. Use these as "checkpoints" in the workflow! These .rds files are an R data format - for more info about .rds files, [visit this website](https://community.rstudio.com/t/what-does-rds-stand-for/6805)

You'll notice that under the lines of code to generate these .rds files in each notebook there is also a function call to the `loadRDS()` function. Uncomment that line to read in any "checkpoint" .rds file. This can save you the time and effort of re-running time-consuming analyses simply to re-run one section of the notebook after any one "checkpoint."
