These datasets are sourced from the following vignettes:

- [Guided Clustering with Seurat](https://satijalab.org/seurat/v3.0/pbmc3k_tutorial.html)

- [Integrating Stimulated vs. Control PBMC datasets] (https://satijalab.org/seurat/v3.0/immune_alignment.html)

It should be noted that the Stimulated vs. Control PBMC dataset is a random subset of the original data (30%, randomly selected), so our vignette in this repo will differ from that found on the Seurat website.
